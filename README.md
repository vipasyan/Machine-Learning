Machine Learning-1 -Mini Project
================================

A Binary Classification of raw data to train a classifier and classify MEMBERS (MEM) and NON-MEMBERS (NMEM)
for any given data. Implementation is in Python language.

Converting raw data to CSV format
---------------------------------

Two raw data files are given, we convert the files to CSV format.
1. ml1data.train.csv and 
2. ml1data.test_unlabled.csv

We use "ml1data.train.csv" as input data for the algorithm and train the algorithm.
We apply this algorithm on "ml1data.test_unlabled.csv" for making the predictions.

Classification using SVM
------------------------

First we import the data "ml1data.train.csv" and use SVM classifier algorithm "Machine Learning project.py"
to classify data and make predictions on "ml1data.test_unlabled.csv" for results. 

We get the "predictions.txt" as result.
